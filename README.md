## Description

Measu is a tool created in 2016 for helping me when I was working in freelance projects for Fluxor, a company that me and [@guilhermelimak](https://github.com/guilhermelimak) were running at that time. 

We used to deal with little ecommerce websites, and clients that just wanted to get a website on internet _(landing pages, ecommerces, blogs, whatever)_.

As these projects are quite simple, I used to measure the full price based in a high-overview of how much time each task would cost.

A task is based in 3 hourly values:

 - Analysis
 - Testing
 - Development

So for a project, it would be needed lots of entries of lots of tasks with these values pretty detailed, and by using a pen and a paper I usually reached some mess some times. _(And I also don't like to use spreadsheets)_

Measu is a tool for people _(like me)_ that want to have an easy way to measure the price of some project for a specific client, even more when it is just about small enhancements or fixes in an existing project.

Also, sometimes, you want to be nice for you client and don't charge him for your mistakes, so measu also allows you to just put that task into your calculations and flag them as `Discounted`, so you actually know how much time you're wasting and money you're losing for just small bugs _(really useful for people who undervalues automated testing, you'll see)_

### [Live Demo](https://measu-a46f5.firebaseapp.com)

## 2016 ~ Present

Nowadays, Fluxor doesn't exists anymore, I don't use Measu anymore, and it is just another project that I keep here for showing up reasons.

Still, I think is a nice project, people can have some insights from it, so the live demo will always be live :)
